Drag and drop the files into your Mods folder

The Sims 4/Mods

In most cases, Mod Settings Menu can be accessed by SHIFT+CLICK on a Sim -> Configure Mod Settings.
If you do not see this interaction it can mean one of the following:
1. You need to run the command `testingcheats on`
2. You do not have another mod installed that makes use of Mod Settings Menu.

Other mods may enable it to appear in various other places, so be sure to read the descriptions of the mods you download for where their settigns should be available at!
